## Architecture

### How It Works

```
Swoole Worker Process (single OS process, 100+ coroutines)
    │
    Pool (Channel-based, per worker)
    │
    ├── init()     → pre-create minConnections, start timers
    │
    ├── borrow()   → pop from Channel (or create on-demand)
    │   ├── Channel has idle item → return immediately
    │   ├── Channel empty, below max → create new (slot reserved before I/O)
    │   └── Channel empty, at max → suspend coroutine, wait for release
    │
    ├── release()  → push back to Channel (with timestamp)
    │   └── Double release silently ignored (spl_object_id tracking)
    │
    ├── discard()  → close permanently, don't return to Channel
    │
    └── close()    → stop timers, close all idle connections
```

The pool is built on `Swoole\Coroutine\Channel` — a coroutine-safe bounded FIFO queue. `pop()` suspends only the calling coroutine (not the worker process). `push()` wakes the next waiting coroutine. Lock-free at the C level.

## ConnectorInterface

The pool doesn't know what it's pooling. The connector tells it how to create, check, and close objects:

```php
interface ConnectorInterface
{
    public function connect(): object;
    public function isAlive(object $connection): bool;
    public function close(object $connection): void;
}
```

Implementations live in the framework kernel, not in this package:

```php
// Example: MongoDB connector (lives in phpdot/dot)
final class MongoConnector implements ConnectorInterface
{
    public function connect(): object
    {
        $connection = new Connection($this->config);
        $connection->connect();
        return $connection;
    }

    public function isAlive(object $connection): bool
    {
        return $connection->isConnected(); // local check, no network
    }

    public function close(object $connection): void
    {
        $connection->close();
    }
}
```

---

## Pool

### Lifecycle

```php
use PHPdot\Pool\Pool;
use PHPdot\Pool\PoolConfig;

// Created in onWorkerStart (after fork)
$pool = new Pool($connector, new PoolConfig(
    minConnections: 2,
    maxConnections: 10,
));

$pool->init(); // pre-creates minConnections, starts timers

// ... application runs, coroutines borrow and release ...

$pool->close(); // onWorkerStop — closes everything
```

### Borrow

```php
$connection = $pool->borrow();
```

1. If the Channel has idle connections → returns one immediately
2. If empty but below `maxConnections` → creates a new one (slot reserved before I/O to prevent race)
3. If at capacity → suspends the coroutine until a connection is released
4. If timeout → throws `BorrowTimeoutException`
5. If pool closed → throws `PoolClosedException`

### Release

```php
$pool->release($connection);
```

Returns the connection to the Channel. Double release is silently ignored (tracked via `spl_object_id`). If the pool was closed while the connection was borrowed, the connection is closed instead.

### Discard

```php
$pool->discard($connection);
```

Permanently closes the connection. Not returned to the Channel. Decrements the pool count, allowing a new connection to be created on the next borrow.

### Stats

```php
$stats = $pool->stats();

$stats->active;       // currently borrowed
$stats->idle;         // sitting in Channel
$stats->total;        // active + idle
$stats->borrowCount;  // total borrows since init
$stats->releaseCount;
$stats->discardCount;
$stats->createCount;
$stats->closeCount;
$stats->timeoutCount;
$stats->waitingCount; // coroutines waiting for a connection right now
```

### Close

```php
$pool->close();
```

Stops timers, closes all idle connections. Borrowed connections are closed when released/discarded. Idempotent.

---

## PoolConfig

```php
new PoolConfig(
    minConnections: 2,                  // pre-created, never shrink below
    maxConnections: 10,                 // hard limit per worker
    borrowTimeout: 3.0,                 // seconds to wait when exhausted
    maxIdleTime: 300.0,                 // seconds before idle cleanup (0.0 = disabled)
    idleCheckInterval: 30.0,            // seconds between cleanup runs
    heartbeatInterval: 0.0,             // seconds between heartbeat (0.0 = disabled)
    validateOnBorrowAfterIdle: 5.0,     // call isAlive() on borrow when idle ≥ this many seconds
                                        //   0.0 = always validate; negative = disabled
    validateOnReturn: false,            // call isAlive() on release; close (don't re-pool) dead
);
```

**Total database connections = workers x maxConnections.** 4 workers x 10 max = 40 max connections.

---

## Idle Cleanup

Purpose: shrink the pool after traffic spikes. Not for connection health.

When `maxIdleTime > 0.0`, a timer runs every `idleCheckInterval` seconds:
1. Skip if coroutines are waiting for connections
2. Pop idle items from Channel
3. Close items idle longer than `maxIdleTime` (only if above `minConnections`)
4. Push back the rest
5. Refill to `minConnections` if needed

```php
new PoolConfig(
    minConnections: 2,
    maxConnections: 10,
    maxIdleTime: 300.0,       // close after 5 min idle
    idleCheckInterval: 30.0,  // check every 30s
);
```

Set `maxIdleTime: 0.0` to disable.

---

## Heartbeat

Purpose: safety net for dead connections. Disabled by default.

When `heartbeatInterval > 0.0`, a timer checks idle connections via `ConnectorInterface::isAlive()`:
1. Skip if coroutines are waiting
2. Pop all idle items
3. Close dead ones (`isAlive() === false`)
4. Push back alive ones
5. Refill to `minConnections`

```php
new PoolConfig(heartbeatInterval: 60.0);
```

`isAlive()` should be lightweight. A single round-trip ping (e.g. `SELECT 1`) is acceptable and is the recommended implementation — for typical drivers, only a server-side check detects connections killed by `wait_timeout`, firewall idle drops, or server restarts.

---

## Validate-on-Borrow

Purpose: catch dead connections at the moment they're handed to a caller, before the caller spends a query learning the connection is broken. TTL-gated to avoid pinging on every hot-path borrow.

When `validateOnBorrowAfterIdle ≥ 0.0` and a popped connection has been idle ≥ that many seconds, the pool calls `isAlive()` before returning it. If dead, the connection is closed and the borrow loop continues — either popping another or creating a fresh one.

```php
new PoolConfig(
    validateOnBorrowAfterIdle: 5.0,   // ping if idle ≥ 5s
    // 0.0  = always validate (every borrow)
    // -1.0 = disabled
);
```

Hot borrow/release cycles skip the check; only "stale" connections get pinged.

---

## Validate-on-Return

Purpose: belt-and-suspenders — catch connections that have died mid-use before they're put back in the pool.

When `validateOnReturn = true`, `release()` calls `isAlive()` on the returned connection. Dead connections are closed (not re-pooled), and the pool refills toward `minConnections`.

```php
new PoolConfig(validateOnReturn: true);
```

Off by default — the connection just succeeded a query, so the check is usually redundant. Enable for "no tolerance" production stances.

---

## Edge Cases

### Double Release

Tracked via `spl_object_id`. Second `release()` on the same connection is silently ignored. Prevents Channel corruption.

### Pool Exhaustion

All connections borrowed, new coroutine calls `borrow()`:
- Coroutine is **suspended** (not the worker process)
- Other coroutines continue running
- When any coroutine releases → waiting coroutine resumes
- If `borrowTimeout` expires → `BorrowTimeoutException`

### Connect Failure During Init

If `connector->connect()` throws during `init()`, the error is skipped. The pool starts with fewer connections. On-demand creation in `borrow()` fills the gap.

### Borrow After Close

Throws `PoolClosedException` immediately.

### Race Condition Prevention

On-demand creation in `borrow()` increments `currentCount` **before** calling `connect()` (which yields on I/O). This prevents multiple coroutines from passing the `< maxConnections` check simultaneously — the slot is reserved before any yield point.

---

## Framework Wiring

The developer never touches the pool. The framework kernel wires it:

```php
// Swoole mode (in onWorkerStart)
$pool = new Pool(new MongoConnector($config), new PoolConfig(...));
$pool->init();

$container->scoped(Connection::class, function () use ($pool) {
    $connection = $pool->borrow();
    Coroutine::defer(fn () => $pool->release($connection));
    return $connection;
});

// FPM mode — no pool, direct binding
$container->singleton(Connection::class, fn () => new Connection($config));
```

Developer code is identical in both modes:

```php
public function __construct(private Connection $mongodb) {}
```
